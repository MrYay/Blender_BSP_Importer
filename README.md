# Blender BSP Importer

This is a .bsp file importer which supports different id tech 3 games bsp formats. It also features md3 and tiki tan importers and exporters as also a WIP .map importer. Materials are approximated from the .shader files of the games. All files are also read from a virtual file system that can read pk3 files. Configuring the base path in the addons preferences is recommended for this.

Blender versions 2.93 to 4.2 are supported right now
